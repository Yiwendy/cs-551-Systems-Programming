I have a test program that I will use for grading this assignment. To
help you with debugging I'm providing a script so you can run it to
help identify issues. I am not releasing the source to the test program,
although since it is compiled with symbols you can get info on failures
like segfaults with gdb.

In an empty directory in your priv, put your my_malloc.c. Then run

/home/cs551001/share/labs/lab1/compile-testprog

If the compile succeeds it will have crated an executable program
"testprog" in your directory.

You can then run "./testprog" to see how your my_malloc library does
against my tests.

To see what a perfect running solution would produce you can run
/home/cs551001/share/labs/lab1/sample-testprog. You will notice 2 points
of failure that are tested by source inspection, and not by running the
testprog.

Of course you need to do this logged in on a lab machine.
